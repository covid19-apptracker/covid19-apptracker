Help to flatten the curve of people infected by coronavirus. If you\u2019ve meet somebody infected: If you meet somebody who will later test positive for coronavirus, the hygienic station will be able to contact you by phone. Even if you just stayed close to each other in a shop. If you get infected: If you test positive for coronavirus, a hygienic station worker will ask for a list of people that you\u2019ve met in the last days. You can simply, in one-click, send them an anonymous list of eRou\u0161ka users that you were in close contact with. Including those you don't know personally, but you happened to share the same bus ride with, for instance. Nobody will know that you might have been the one who helped spread the virus on them.",
