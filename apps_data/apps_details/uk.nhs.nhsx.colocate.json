We'd like to thank everyone on the Isle of Wight for the vital role they have played. We will use the lessons we have learned on the island to inform the next phase of development. If you took part in the trial by downloading the app on your smartphone, please now delete the app. If you are feeling unwell, please follow the official NHS advice on nhs.uk.  If you have coronavirus symptoms, call 119 to book a test.",
