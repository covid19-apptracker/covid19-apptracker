  "description": "Do your part in the fight to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Florida. The StrongerThanC19 App allows you to anonymously answer a brief series of survey questions, ranging from general demographics to recent travel and possible exposure to COVID-19, to help Florida better identify and predict coronavirus trends across the state. Once the survey is completed, you will receive guidance on prevention practices, testing, and vulnerable populations. Features include: 1. Ability to go back and update your answers as symptoms and information change, providing officials with up-to-the-minute information to help improve the distribution of resources in response to COVID-19. 2. Access to information in real-time as it\u2019s gathered from users across the state via the Community Action Survey Report.  Report includes results by date; age group; county; recent travel; symptoms; sought medical care; and more. 3.  Have trusted information and resources* at your fingertips including (1) \u201cSTEPS\u201d of preparedness and prevention measures; (2) Florida\u2019s COVID-19 status and what you need to know; and (3) Reliable contact information for questions regarding COVID-19 in Florida. 4.  Sign up to receive notifications and the most up to date information on COVID-19 in Florida. Everyone has a role to play to help us flatten the COVID-19 curve. Two minutes of your time can help make Florida communities healthier. If we all work together, we can slow the spread. *Please remember, the resources provided on the app do not replace or take priority over guidance from health care professionals.",
