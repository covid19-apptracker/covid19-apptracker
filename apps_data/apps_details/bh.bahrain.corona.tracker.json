  "description": "BeAware Bahrain - Together Against COVID-19: As citizens and residents, we have both a community and individual responsibility to safeguard the safety and well-being of all. Be Aware is a mobile application that assists efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 by advancing contact tracing efforts. How will the app achieve its objectives? The app utilises location data shared by users to alert the following: - Individuals in the event they approach a location where an active case has been detected, or if they were in close proximity with an active case - Track the movement of quarantine cases for a duration of 14 days, and ensure they abide by quarantine regulations - Track active cases and provide contact tracing updates - Highlight COVID-19 developments - Publish latest recommendations issued by the Kingdom\u2019s health authorities",
