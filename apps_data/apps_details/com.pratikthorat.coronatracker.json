  "description": "While the coronavirus pandemic and climate change are inherently different issues, they share two important characteristics: both are global crises that threaten the lives of millions of people. As of Today the number of coronavirus infections approaches 100,000 people worldwide & increasing in India very rapidly. In continuation to initiative taken by the Maharashtra government to reduce exposure of COVID-19, Suspected should undergo home quarantine for few weeks. These home quarantined people are supposed to stay home / hospital. Unfortunately many of them are not following these guidelines. To stop people doing this, we have developed technological solution (Android application & website) to monitor home quarantined people with GPS system from corporation office itself. Alongside to tracking, we can generate different reports which you need to share with health officials every day.",
