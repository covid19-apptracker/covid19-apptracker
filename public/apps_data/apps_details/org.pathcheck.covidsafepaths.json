  "description": "Safe Paths can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Select Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available.\nComing Soon: Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.\nWe are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.\nThe Safe Paths team is composed of engineers, epidemiologists, data privacy evangelists, professors, and researchers, and is guided by mentors from the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization, and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies.\nThe Safe Paths program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck, Inc (PCI), established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the COVID Safe Paths app and Safe Places tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities.\nThe goal of Safe Paths is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.",
