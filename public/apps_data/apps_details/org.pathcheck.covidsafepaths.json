The goal of Safe Paths is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.\",\n  \"app_store_url\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pathcheck.covidsafepaths\",\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"Device & app history\": [\n      \"Retrieve running apps\"\n    ],\n    \"Photos/Media/Files\": [\n      \"Read the contents of your usb storage\",\n      \"Modify or delete the contents of your usb storage\"\n    ],\n    \"Storage\": [\n      \"Read the contents of your usb storage\",\n      \"Modify or delete the contents of your usb storage\"\n    ],\n    \"Location\": [\n      \"Approximate location (network-based)\",\n      \"Precise location (gps and network-based)\",\n      \"Access extra location provider commands\"\n    ],\n    \"Wi-Fi connection information\": [\n      \"View wi-fi connections\"\n    ],\n    \"Other\": [\n      \"Receive data from internet\",\n      \"Pair with bluetooth devices\",\n      \"Run at startup\",\n      \"View network connections\",\n      \"Google play license check\",\n      \"Full network access\",\n      \"Control vibration\",\n      \"Read sync settings\",\n      \"Create accounts and set passwords\",\n      \"Prevent device from sleeping\",\n      \"Toggle sync on and off\",\n      \"Access bluetooth settings\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"
