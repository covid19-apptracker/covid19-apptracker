  "description": "eRou\u0161ka's contribution to the fight against the pandemic is over. Thank you all! It notified the users about more than 400,000 risky encounters and recommended safety measures. It helped to diminish the spread of infection and to manage the epidemic. It cooperated with similar applications in other EU countries and watched over risky encounters with foreigners in the Czech Republic and abroad. Due to a certain level of vaccination, other tools, and the epidemic's development, the app is no longer needed.",
