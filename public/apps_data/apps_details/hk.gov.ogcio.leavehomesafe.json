  "description": "The LeaveHomeSafe mobile app provides citizens a convenient digital tool to record their visit history themselves on their mobile phones by scanning QR codes displayed in venues for the use in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days. If there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues. Upon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts. The LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
