  "description": "As new variants arise, you can continue to protect yourself, your loved ones, and community through anonymous exposure notifications with the Covid Watch Arizona App. Once you opt-in and enable exposure notifications on your phone, Covid Watch Arizona starts working immediately to detect if you come into close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. The app is fully anonymous and has no access to your location or personal information. It\u2019s simple, safe, and secure. If you test positive for COVID-19 through a clinic, workplace, or self-administered test, you can share your test results and anonymously notify those who were nearby who may have been exposed to coronavirus. The app is customized to your county, university or other community in Arizona so that you can get immediate access to the most up-to-date and reliable information on how to protect yourself and others from new variants. The more people who download the app, the more effective we can be. So encourage your friends, family, and colleagues to install Covid Watch Arizona today. Provided by WeHealth Solutions, a public benefit corporation and the developer of Covid Watch Arizona, with a mission to end the threat and burden of infectious diseases. Released in partnership with the University of Arizona on behalf of Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS).",
