  "description": "Together, let\u2019s slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive. COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. You\u2019ll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes. If you test positive for COVID-19 you\u2019ll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server. Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed. COVID Alert has no way of knowing: -your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services -your name or address -the place or time you were near someone -if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app. It\u2019s still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, you\u2019ll find out if you were near them. COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.",
