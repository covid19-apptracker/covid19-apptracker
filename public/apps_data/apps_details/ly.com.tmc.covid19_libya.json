  "description": "The application expresses two features. First, it is a tracker application that makes every person in the country of Libya aware of the number of cases in his/her own city. Second, the application works as a communication channel between the health organizations in Libya and the public, so that individuals who are experiencing the symptoms of COVID19 can request a diagnostic test through the application. With that, the application can help avoid mass gatherings at hospitals which will limit the transmission of the virus.",
