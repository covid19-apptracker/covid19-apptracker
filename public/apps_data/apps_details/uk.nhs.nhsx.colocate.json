  "description": "This is the first version of the app, currently available for Isle of Wight residents only. If you develop symptoms of coronavirus and report them in the app, the NHS COVID-19 app will anonymously warn those that you have been near to. They will receive advice from the NHS on the right action to take to stop the virus spreading further. This means that people can be quickly encouraged to self-isolate before they become infectious, allowing the country to stay one step ahead of the virus.",
