  "description": "Background COVID-19 Ethiopia is a health worker learning/training platform supported by the Community Health Academy-Last Mile Health using the OppiaMobile app technology. Objective To reach health workers with appropriate, up-to-date and multimedia aided COVID-19 information and training content on mobile devices accessed anywhere, anytime. One of the major limiting factors to a timely COVID-19 response is the need for social distancing which prevents traditional capacity building efforts such as face-to-face training. COVID-19 Ethiopia training platform has been developed to address this need in a timely manner. What is it? OppiaMobile is an open source mobile learning platform specially designed for delivering learning content such as multimedia and quizzes in low-resource settings. Course content can be developed in Moodle and then exported to run offline on the OppiaMobile Android app. Who is the Target Audience? Frontline health workers including; nurses, health officers, physicians, volunteers working in health facilities and other health service delivery points set up for COVID-19 across all 11 regions of Ethiopia. How Does It Work? Once COVID-19 Ethiopia is downloaded onto a smart phone or tablet, the training content is readily available for use offline. Users earn points for engagement with the course content, and badges when they complete a course. When a course is updated, users are automatically notified that a new version is available, so they can keep their course content up-to-date. Rollout \u2022\tFMOH, EPHI and Community Health Academy will jointly launch the training platform and upload on google Playstore. \u2022\tFMOH/EPHI COVID-19 response teams will endorse, approve uploading of training content and protocols on the platform. \u2022\tFrontline health workers, program managers and all public health professionals will be encouraged to download app and access up-to-date and FMOH approved COVID-19 content. \u2022\tThe training platform/app has already been uploaded on 500 tablets to be distributed by FMOH free of charge to COVID-19 response team members. \u2022\tSurveillance \u2022\tCase Management \u2022\tLaboratory \u2022\tInfection Prevention and Control \u2022\tRisk Communication and Community Engagement \u2022\tCOVID-19 handbook for Health Workers How to Access COVID-19 Ethiopia Training App Users can download the COVID-19 Ethiopia Training App from the Google Playstore.
