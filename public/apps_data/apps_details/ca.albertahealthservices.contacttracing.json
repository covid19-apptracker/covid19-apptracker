  "description": "This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta. This app is intended for ages 14+. Some of the key benefits of this app are to: - Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected. - Help keep Albertans safe by quickly identifying close contacts of infected person and enabling Alberta Health Services (AHS) to get them the guidance and care they need, reducing the spread of COVID-19 and helping them protect their family, friends and community. The ABTraceTogether app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works. The ABTraceTogether app uses a secure, community-driven approach where mobile devices exchange Bluetooth-enabled secure encrypted tokens when another device with the app installed is detected nearby. If an Albertan tests positive for COVID-19, a Contact Tracer from AHS will get in touch with the infected person using contact information provided at the testing center. This process does not change from existing AHS leading practices. When an infected person is contacted by a Contact Tracer, the infected person will be asked if they use the ABTraceTogether app, and will be asked to voluntarily upload the encrypted data from the app. This information will be critical to help increase the speed and effectiveness of Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 response. Once AHS receives the encrypted data, AHS Contact Tracers will be able to use that information to reach the other app users who have had close contact with the infected person. Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. Enabling Bluetooth and Location Services is used solely to improve the app\u2019s functionality by allowing the app to operate regardless of the device\u2019s lock/unlock state or the app\u2019s foreground/background status. Personal information, and location information or GPS coordinates are not used, captured, or stored. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users. Personal Information collected: - Phone number Permissions required: - Bluetooth enabled - Location - Push notifications (optional) ABTraceTogether is intended to be used for case and contact tracing to identify possible exposures to COVID-19. It is not intended for use in the diagnosis, or treatment of COVID-19. Individuals should be vigilant and follow public health guidelines and recommendations. Anyone experiencing COVID-19 related symptoms should complete the online self-assessment athttps://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx or contact Health Link by calling 811.
