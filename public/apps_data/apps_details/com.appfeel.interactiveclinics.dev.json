  "description": "The \"Interactive Clinics\" application allows you to precisely record multiple metrics and health data through a SmartPhone or tablet. FEATURES \u2022 COVID-19 (Coronavirus): Monitoring of the evolution of the disease \u2022 Pain level: The first scientifically validated application in the prestigious JMIR magazine with an impact factor of 4.95 out of 5 \u2022 Medication adherence: Monitoring and alerts of taking medications \u2022 Physical activity level: Track metrics through connection to SmartWatch devices (Android or iOS) Your data will NOT be shared with unauthorized third parties. No one other than those you indicate will have access to your data. COVID-19 MODULE \u2022 Monitoring of the patient's temperature, questionnaire to monitor the evolution of the disease such as respiratory problems, level of chest pain, abdominal pain, among others. The module has been developed in collaboration with high-level international doctors, researchers and academics. Reflects the diagnostic requirements described by the WHO (World Health Organization): https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#:~:text=symptoms \u2022 Share disease monitoring data with linked medical centers. \u2022 High-quality conference call with related health professionals. \u2022 Map of the different medical centers linked to Interactive Clinics and heat map of the COVID-19 case rate. PAIN LEVEL MODULE This is the first scientifically validated application that has published the results in the prestigious scientific journal JMIR, number 1 in the \"digital health\" category, with an impact factor of 4.945 out of 5. More information: https://www.jmir.org/2020/2/e13468/ Our team has developed a modern version of the Visual Analogue Scala (pVAS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale), called Electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS). The application allows the user to record the level of pain through their device. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MODULE The physical activity module allows you to obtain the number of consumed calories, minutes of exercise and level of sedentary lifestyle. These metrics allow you to see the evolution of physical activity from day to day and combined with blood glucose level data allow specialists to closely monitor the evolution of type 2 diabetes. Recent studies show that physical activity helps control blood glucose level. Along with diet, physical exercise is one of the fundamental pillars of the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Through this application you will be able to monitor your level of physical activity and also help health professionals in the monitoring of treatment. PLEASE NOTE \u2022 The Interactive Clinics App does NOT provide a medical interpretation of the value recorded in the Pain Level Module \u2022 The Interactive Clinics App itself will NOT provide any type of direct or indirect doctor consultation or any medical related health advice. Also, it does not provide any medical reports that can inform or misinform the users in any aspect of their health. \u2022 The Interactive Clinics App itself does NOT provide or share any information with any doctor or anyone else regarding the user progress of any outcome. Only if the user consents to connect the Interactive Clinics App with the interactiveclinics.com website, then a possible personal-trainer or allied health professional may observe the information that the user willingly decided to share. The personal-trainer or allied health profession can potentially send to the user a short text via push-notification with the aim to motivate the user to meet the daily exercise target. Enjoy while taking care of your health!",
