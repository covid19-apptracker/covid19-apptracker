## About the Project
With the current pandemic, security and privacy concerns have emerged around the large number of applications being quickly developed and promoted around the globe. From symptom tracking to contact tracing, the COVID-19 App Tracker Project (https://covid19apptracker.org) aims to automate the detection of new applications published on the Google Play Store and create an open data set for further analysis and insights.

At this time, the COVID-19 App Tracker Project only looks for applications on the Google Play Store that fall within at least one of the following categories: 

- Contact Tracing
- Symptom Tracking
- COVID-19 Information

## Our Intended Audience
We hope this project leads to greater transparency around how the data is collected, used, stored, and maintained long-term. We created this project for the following groups so that they may be better equipped to conduct further research or advocate for specific changes they see fit for their communities.

- Researchers
- Privacy Advocates
- Journalists
- General Public
