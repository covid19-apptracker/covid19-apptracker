## About the Project
With the current pandemic has emerged privacy concerns with the large number of applications being published and promoted around the globe. From symptom tracking to contact tracing, the open source project, COVID-19 App Tracker, aims to identify and track applications published on the Google Play Store.

At this time, the COVID-19 App Tracker only looks for applications on the Google Play Store that fall within at least one of the following categories:

- Contact Tracing
- Symptom Tracking
- COVID-19 Information

We are a team of volunteers, but we encourage feedback! If you see apps missing or corrections that should be made, please contact us at info@covid19apptracker.org and we'll do our best to add them quickly. We hope this project encourages greater transparency and leads to further privacy research around the globe.

## Our Intended Audience
We hope this project leads to greater transparency for these new applicationsâ€™ privacy and security implications around the globe. Many apps are being created quickly, resulting in poor security or are not clearly articulating how they are using the data they are collecting. We created this project for the following groups so that they may be better equipped to conduct further research or advocate for specific changes they see fit for their communities.

- Researchers
- Privacy Advocates
- Journalists
- General Public
